    "## Model Ideas\n",
    "Now that we have cleaned and transformed our dataset, we can consider ideas regarding our approach to choosing and training a predictive model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Considerations\n",
    "Given that this dataset is over 100,000 rows, we must be cognizant of our memory usage and our model complexity. Given that our machine is not specifically built with data science in mind, we must operate within the memory and time constraints of our machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Text-Based Approach\n",
    "#### Overview\n",
    "One property of our dataset as it stands is that the text field 'PlayerLine' holds the highest quantity of raw information in each row. By extracting textual patterns, word usage, and word frequency for each player, it shall be possible to predict the player based on these textual cues. The common approach in this type of endeavor is to employ a vectorizer that will do the following:\n",
    "1. Tokenize all text to create new features based on words, bigrams, trigrams, etc.\n",
    "2. Vectorize each row's text field into a vector representing the count or frequency of each token\n",
    "After these steps, we shall use the vectorized data to train a model (e.g. Naive Bayes). Then, we shall evaluate the model with test data to determine the model's predictive success rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Splitting Dataset into Multiple Datasets (by 'Play')\n",
    "A property of the current dataset is that it is quite large (over 100,000 rows). In the pursuit of a player classification technique over the text field, we shall split our dataset by play name into distinct datasets and form distinct models for each play. Since the 'Play' attribute shall be given to us in the final evaluation, we may use this information to conditionally choose which model to run on a given record to output the estimated 'Player'. By reducing our dataset into pieces and forming separate models, we increase the likelihood of choosing the correct player. Essentially, this approach is expressing that, first and foremost, the 'Play' attribute must be matched in the model. In addition to the predictive potential of this new approach, the smaller datasets allow for more intensive text analysis on each play due to more free memory on the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Testing this Approach\n",
    "We shall employ the text-based approach on a subset of the data to determine its practicality and effectiveness potential. In particular, we shall test this on the data for \"Henry IV\".\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Process\n",
    "We will perform the following high-level steps to accomplish this vectorization process:\n",
    "1. Define a vectorizer to be a ScikitLearn TF-IDF tokenizer class instance (Term frequency-inverse document frequency)\n",
    "2. Tokenize our input text\n",
    "    * We will specify the tokenizer to include single words as tokens\n",
    "    * This will help to capture the context of the characters' language in a vectorized numerical form\n",
    "3. Generate a new set of features to match the tokens found in all the text (from each row)\n",
    "4. Run the vectorizer capability on each row to fill the corresponding normalized token frequencies"

This low accuracy measure is an indicator that this paradigm is inherently flawed and the patterns that may be extracted from the text are quite sparse barring the use of more advanced methods. In addition to the low accuracy, it is simply not feasible to execute this type of classification model on the entire dataset due to memory constraints of our target machine. This leads us to pursue other options."

My hypothesis is that, due to the conditional structure of the numerical data as it relates to the player output, we may use a Decision Tree model with success. In addition, since the memory overhead of this model is much lower, we may process the entire dataset in a single model."

    "#### Results\n",
    "As we can see above, we achieved roughly 75% accuracy on our tree-based model. This model was very fast and required very little memory compared to the text vectorization model. These properties enabled us to train and test our entire dataset at one time. Although this percentage isn't perfect, the high speed and low memory allow us to work with this model over our entire dataset.\n",

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "The text-based analysis and modeling proved to be difficult in this project due to the sheer amount of data and the lack of textual patterns available to classify characters. On the contrary, utilization of the numerical features of our dataset and the deployment of a decision tree model proved to be not only much more accurate, but also fast and memory efficient in the context of our entire dataset. Although the text model proved ineffective in our limited trial, the idea may still be put to good use in conjuction to a tree-based model. Due to time constraints, we were not able to explore the concept of model combination, but this concept may prove useful in the context of this problem."
